### Goal of the IssueTracker 

IssueTracker lets tracking of various issues that we face everyday. The focus is on "I" rather than "others".

As stages of our lives move on, environment/job/interest/network changes, responsibilities/rights/duties change, knowledge/belief/way of thinking changes, and as a result, we come to think of variety of topics in different ways and let them pass through our minds rather than building them up on another. 

IssueTracker is intended to help memorizing what "the wise I in the past" thought on various topics, help communicating with "the wise I in the past", and help advancing "the current I" on current issues.

At the same time, in IssueTracker, one can also get help from others, be motivated by others, and one can help/motivate others as well. All these can be done in a simple social-networking-design as described below.
