USER TIER: 
- Issuetracker Citizen: entry level user
- VIP: no specific privilage assigned (need to be implemented)
- Public Card Manager: manages public cards
- Staff / Superuser: no specific privilage assigned

Public Card:
 (a) pub card owner (by definition pub mgr) - post (pa) 
 (b) other pub mgr - post (pb) 
 (c) other general user - author - post (pc) 
 (d) other general user - not a author

- Public card status cannot be changed
- write: all allowed
  -> currently, only pub_card_mgr can write posts in public cards
  -> general user - can only write into public cards through publish(?)
                  - or, allow general user to write directly in pulbic cards(?)
- delete / edit:
     (pa), (pb), (pc)
  (a) yes, no, yes(tbc - note)
  (b) no, yes, no
  (c) no, no, yes
  (d) no, no, no
  note: if a pub card is deleted, test_func in post_view() is not called (that is, of course in a sense)
        also if it is published, only published post can be deleted... not the post in private card...

Official Public Card:
- the same as Public Card but gnenral user cannot write/delete/edit
- pub card managers can make a official card
- Official status cannot be changed

IMPORT / PUBLISH
- private post -> public post: "Publish", you can copy the post to a public card 
    soft copy
         . the date has to be public time 
         . make it only 1 publish is possible
         . comments in published card can be seen in private card as well
         . Post model has to be changed to track published card
- public card -> private card: "Import", you can copy the post to a private card
    soft copy
- Do I really need import? (or, just like will be enough -> make a page with likes, e.g. through search)

To implement:
- card order changer implement 
   . who will manage public card order(maybe staff?)
- card categorization implmenet (maybe later)
- comment system implement
- search (refer to previous implement)
- about-page revise
- Publish / Import counter
- time concept: created time vs edited time vs published time vs publisehd but edited time




<PAGE DESIGN - PUBLISH>
- Post Create / Update page -> put a publish button
- Publish button clicked -> Create a view to select which card to publish
- A card is chosen -> both the private card and public card have a same post
- Post model -> a new attr 'published_card' <- a card
- Card model -> a nwe attr 'published_posts' <- array of posts (do I need to develop a new wheel?)
=> Or instead, publish just change card... to destination public card
