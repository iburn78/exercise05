am I looking at a private card / post or public???? be clear... 

PUBLIC CARD MANAGER -> all managers can delete card? or creater can only delete the card? 

IF A CARD IS ONCE PUBLIC, IT CANNOT GO BACK TO PRIVATE.... (NEED TO MAKE IT IMPLEMENTED....)

Multiple images in a post 
- [ ] currently only image1 is shown in post-list-view in a card (i.e., implement carousel in post-list-view as well)
