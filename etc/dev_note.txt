image selection for user photo: multiful basic images 
make carousel element full width

for below items click will lead to post_detail.html so I need it (with goback to prev page)
 - search function -> post search  
 - author post list  
 - tag post list

when deleting a card, add logic to handle posts (e.g., put max limit on the number of posts to perform delete the current card...)

make prettier full image screen (when clicking a post image)

IF A CARD IS ONCE PUBLIC, IT CANNOT GO BACK TO PRIVATE.... (NEED TO MAKE IT IMPLEMENTED....)

Multiple images in a post 
- [ ] currently only image1 is shown in post-list-view in a card (i.e., implement carousel in post-list-view as well)

Card arrangement
- [ ] Private/public cards have to be in accordian (bootstrap)
- [ ] Private/public cards might be grouped into menu/nav

Card movements
- [ ] may implement Apple-Album style (or much simpler) card movements using CSS/JS
