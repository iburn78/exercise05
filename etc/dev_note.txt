IMPORT / PUBLISH
- public card -> private card: not allowed (maybe allowed for archive purpose... or, do it by categorize the card to 'archived')
- private card -> public card: allowed
- private post -> public post: "Publish", you can copy the post to a public card 
    1) soft copy (guess this might be the right way)
         . the date has to be public time 
         . make it only 1 publish is possible
         . comments in published card can be seen in private card as well
         . Post model has to be changed to track published card
    2) deep copy 
         . only 1 publish is has to be allowed
         . linkage may be made through a link (not if edit involves, it could be complicated)
- public card -> private card: "Import", you can copy the post to a private card
    1) soft copy (guess this might be the right way)
    2) deep copy

To implement:
- card order changer implement
- card categorization implmenet (may be later)
- comment system implement
- search (refer to previous implement)
- about page revise
- Publish / Import counter
- time concept: created time vs edited time vs published time vs publisehd but edited time
